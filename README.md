# Command Line Messenger

### Introduction
This app was a project from CSSE2310 at UQ. It is an instant messaging app that uses TCP to connect clients on the same local network. It utilises a multithreaded server which waits for connections and creates a new thread whenever a client connects. The clients communicate through a "text-based" protocol over TCP/IP. Clients can select a unique name for themselves, send messages to each other which are broadcast to all connections as well as kicking other users, quitting the chat at any time and asking for a list of all connected clients.
